            <li> Data visualization is an important skill in applied statistics and machine learning.</li>
            <p/>
            <li> Statistics does indeed focus on quantitative descriptions and estimations of data. Data visualization provides an important suite of tools for gaining a qualitative understanding.</li>
            <p/>
            <li> This can be helpful when exploring and getting to know a dataset and can help with identifying patterns, corrupt data, outliers, and much more. With a little domain knowledge, data visualizations can be used to express and demonstrate key relationships in plots and charts.</li>

            <ul>
                <li> Random forest regression is a supervised learning algorithm. The benefit of the random forest is, it very well may be utilized for both characterization
                     and relapse issue which structure most of current machine learning framework. Random forest forms numerous decision trees, whats more, adds them together to get an increasingly
                     exact and stable expectation. Random Forest has nearly the equivalent parameters as a decision tree or a stowing classifier model. It is very simple to discover the significance of each element on the expectation when contrasted with others in this calculation.</li>

            <ul>
                <li> Random Forest model has the best accuracy in predicting the price of the flight with the help of different features with an R-Squared score (It is a statistical measure thatÂ represents the proportion of the variance for a dependent variable that's explained by an independent variableÂ or variables in a regression model) of above 85% (85.44%).</li>
                <p/>
                <li> From the above visualization, the difference in the actual price and the predicted price of flight is forming a bell curve as most of the values are present in the range of -5000 to +5000.</li>
                <p/>
                <li> Mean Absolute error for this model is around 1,119 and root mean square error is 1,790. Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) are metrics used to evaluate a Regression Model. These metrics tell us how accurate our predictions are and, 
                    what is the amount of deviation from the actual values.RMSE is theÂ Root of theÂ Mean of theÂ Square ofÂ Errors and MAE is theÂ Mean ofÂ Absolute value ofÂ Errors.</li>
